audio player demo using highspeed uart to download audio files
USB to UART converter: CH343
Baudrate: 6Mbps
TX: PE1
RX: PE0

Usage:
1、打开pwm_dac.py，在UART_PORT处填入CH343对应的串口号，然后保存运行pwm_dac.py
2、点击“生成文件信息”，python程序开始将audio_file文件夹内的所有文件转换为需要写入的数据
3、生成结束后，audio_table.h被更新，音频文件被编号，同时pwm_dac.py的同级路径下出现audio.bin文件
4、重新编译keil工程，下载工程到MCU
5、MCU开始运行程序后，板载LED亮起表示正在擦除板载SPI FLASH，擦除完成后板载LED熄灭
6、点击“发送音频文件”，python程序控制串口把处理完成的数据发送到MCU，MCU把数据写入到SPI FLASH
7、观察进度条，等待发送完成
8、按板载按键KEY3，LED亮起800ms后熄灭，MCU进入播放模式
9、按照audio_table.h内的音频文件编号，在“音频编号”的文本框内填入需要播放的编号，开始播放
